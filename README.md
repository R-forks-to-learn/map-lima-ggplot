# A dark-themed map of Lima

Inspired by the excellent article: "[Streetmaps](https://ggplot2tutor.com/streetmaps/streetmaps/)", which uses [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [osmdata](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmdata/) to create nice streetmaps of Freiburg.

The original article generated an image using R, and then retouched it in MS Powerpoint. Here I tried to use only R for the whole process.

Here is the map as a PNG:

But I think the PDF version looks better.
